I use these scripts on my daily basis. but you can try these too!

## CSC.py
it is python script to connect with any cloud service Linux machine. But you will need to change some variables. 
For examples, You will need to change the SSH key path in child variable.
### I have created a docker container in Linux. Thats what made me lazy to first go to linux and then start Docker. And thats why i Created this script.
#### I am still working on this script. gonna make more changes.

RUN:
```
python3 CSC.py
```
